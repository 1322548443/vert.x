/**
 * Sometimes the file resources of an application are bundled into jars, or are somewhere on the classpath but not
 * available on the file system, e.g. in the case of a Vert.x webapp bundled as a fat jar.
 *
 * In this case we want the application to access the resource from the classpath as if it was on the file system.
 *
 * We can do this by looking for the file on the classpath, and if found, copying it to a temporary cache directory
 * on disk and serving it from there.
 *
 * There is one cache dir per Vert.x instance and they are deleted on Vert.x shutdown.
